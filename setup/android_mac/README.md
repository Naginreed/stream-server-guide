**Positives**  

- 👍 can be used with a single Internet connection from Phone
- 👍 when connection from Phone is failing, the Viewer will still see Videos/Clips (1x Stream Start and 1x VOD)
- 👍 a second internet can be added to make the Phone Connection more reliable
- 👍 when switching from WiFi to Mobile and back stream is not going offline

**Negatives**  

- 👎 Additional monthly cost for Relay Server ($10 USD)
- 👎 Additional monthly cost for 2nd Internet (Optional)
- 👎 Takes some time for first Setup

# 5 - Make OBS pretty
We are finished with the basic Setup, but the Scenes are pretty emtpy.
Following is an Explanation on what Scene is used for what and what People normally put in. 
> [!NOTE]  
> Following are just recommendations. Feel free to design however you want.

**Start**
- Every time the Stream starts with this scene until the phone is live
- Video+Music is often used as Background
- simple Text "Starting Soon ..."

**Live**
- As soon as there is a connection from the Phone to OBS this will be shown
- No additional things needed, since Overlays should run on the Phone

**Low**
- When connection to the Phone is bad quality
- simple Text "low bitrate"
  
**Brb**
- When the connection to Phone is lost completely or you end the livestream in IRLPro on purpose *(for privacy)*
- old VODs or Clips are often used (For Clips i recommend a Folder named Clips and adding a VLC Media Source *requires [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)*)
- simple Text "Be right back"
- Can be switched to when you go to Toilet or have private Conversation for a few Minutes
  
**End**
- Can be activated by writing !end in Twitch-Chat
- Similar to Starting Video+Music
- Simple Text "Ending Stream"

---
# 6 - Normal Operation 
> [!NOTE]  
> Before **every** IRL-Stream you need to do the following

6.a - **Start** your **PC** at Home an make sure it has a Internet Connection and that the PC doesn't turn off automatically  
6.b - **Start OBS & NOALBS** on your PC  
6.c - **Go outside** to where you want to start your IRL-Stream  
6.d - Enter `!start` in **Twitch-Chat** to start Stream to Twitch  
6.e - **Go Live in IRL Pro** -> after a few seconds you are switched to **Live-Scene**  
6.f - If you stop or loose connections on the Phone -> after a few seconds you are switched to **Brb-Scene**  
6.g - As soon as connection from Phone to Internet is restored -> after a few seconds you are switched back to **Live-Scene**  
6.h - End/Start the Livestream manually in IRLPro to switch between `!brb` and `!live`  
6.i - **Stop the Stream** automatically if you raid someone or with Chat command `!stop`  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> With every Scene Change in OBS you will see a text Message in Chat
---
# 7 - 2nd Internet Connection  
> [!NOTE]  
> This is optional and improves stream stability alot in many cases. But it doesnt prevent outtages in No Service Areas like deep into the Mountains or Tunnels.

As seen in the [Overview](#overview) there can be 2nd Internet Connection for your phone to reduce the chance of outtages for the Live Stream.  
Either a Mobile WiFi Router or a Second Phone with Mobile Hotspot active.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For this second SIM a different Provider is highly recommended.
> The 2nd Sim will also consume about ~50% of the overall Data
---
