## What is a Stream-Server
In IRL Streaming you often come in situations where you want to take a short break, for example, to go to the toilet or hide sensitive information. 
You can *End the Livestream* but it will lose you viewers and create a new VOD every time you do it.
The same happens every time you lose all your phone signal or run out of battery.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Everything that happens on the phone affects directly your stream**

To avoid this, many streamers use a so-called Stream-Server.

They act as a middleman between your phone and the streaming service *(e.g. Twitch, Kick, YouTube)* and can therefore detect any outages of the phone-stream and instead show some funny clips to keep the viewers informed and entertained.
